The rustfmt.toml file that allows long lines must remain.  I'm blind, and navigating 6 character lines via screen reader is a nightmare.

I'm very simplistic, so only grounded and common sense functionality will be added.  No bells and whistles where the user benefit doesn't far outweigh the added complexity.

Feel free to open an issue if you are unsure of anything.
